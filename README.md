In this project, I
* Analyzed Titanic Data which contained demographics and passenger information about 891 of the 
2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. 
* Created a report that posed questions about the dataset, used NumPy and Pandas to answer 
those questions and plotted relevant visualizations about the results.
* Had received rave reviews for my project submission. My project reviewer labelled my project as 
"One of the best reports I've graded.It was a pleasure to look over your project.Truly outstanding 
work on the visualizations. I really appreciate the level of depth with your communication. You do 
a really great job guiding the reader."
